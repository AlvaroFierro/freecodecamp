# Freecodecamp projects

Freecodecamp is a site where you can learn how to code for **free** and building projects you can earn certifications.

There are a plenty majority of courses such as:
  - Responsive Web Design

  - Back End Development and API's
  - Queality Assurance
  - Scientific Computing with Python

  - **Coding Interview Preparation** 

So I'm doing the projects and there will be a lot of this. Maybe I can be a little slow but it's better to comprehend a concept before doing some stuff without comprehension.
